Her family was politically active and on Election Day in 1872, Carrie’s father and some of the male hired help were getting ready to head into town to vote. She asked her mother why she wasn’t getting dressed to go too. Her parents laughingly explained to their daughter that women couldn’t vote."),

Fugitive slave laws passed in 1793 & 1850 violated these rights. While the 1793 law saw little opposition, some Americans immediately rebuked the 1850 law, which today is considered to be among the most unjust and illegitimate laws passed by Congress. This article explores how these laws trampled on individual rights, making a mockery of the U.S. Constitution."),

It was their last, best hope to secure ratification before the fall 1920 national elections; it was their only feasible prospect for gaining the elusive 36th ratification state to make women’s suffrage part of the Constitution. After seven decades of struggle, it would come down to Tennessee, and that was terrifying."),

The objective is to remove enough fuel so that when a wildfire burns, it is less severe and can be more easily suppressed. Hazardous fuel reduction generally requires the reduction of surface and ladder fuels."),

All fuels are removed and the surface is scraped to mineral soil on a strip 6 inches to 3 feet wide, depending upon the fuel and slope. Often a break in the weather allows workers to encircle and contain the fire. Then the hard, dirty work of mop up begins to bring the fire under control. Firefighting resources are released (demobilized) as they are no longer needed."),
